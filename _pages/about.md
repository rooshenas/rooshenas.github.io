  <h1> About Me </h1>
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois Chicago and conducting machine learning research with a focus on the applications of deep generative models in language modeling, machine translation, multimodal learning, and physical sciences. 

<br>
<br>
I had the opportunity to do a post-doctoral research with Andrew McCallum at UMass Amherst, focusing on structured prediction energy networks (SPENs). Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Oregon under the guidance of Daniel Lowd, specializing in tractable probabilistic models and probabilistic circuits.
